# BrewCenterAPI

This project aims to build an opensource, public, free-to-use API for the purpose of providing accurage, up-to-date brewing ingredient data to all users.

A while ago I tried building my own brewing recipe editing software and was shocked at the lack of data available.

This API will eventually be hosted for free, and will use the [beerjson](https://beerjson.github.io/beerjson/) standard.
